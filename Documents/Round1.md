# 📌 BookIT – Automated Meeting Room Booking System  
**Round 1 | The Nest – Where Every Idea Is Born**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BookIT** is an automated meeting room booking system designed to simplify and optimize how organizations manage shared meeting spaces.  
It addresses common challenges such as double bookings, lack of transparency, inefficient resource usage, and unfair access to premium meeting rooms by introducing **role-based access**, **credit-based booking**, and **centralized scheduling**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In organizations, meeting rooms are shared resources that are often booked manually or through fragmented systems. This leads to:

- Double bookings during peak hours  
- No clear visibility into room availability  
- Inefficient utilization of meeting spaces  
- Unfair usage of premium amenities  
- Conflicts due to simultaneous booking attempts  

**BookIT** solves these challenges by providing a **centralized, automated, and scalable meeting room booking platform** with controlled access, dynamic pricing, and concurrency handling.
